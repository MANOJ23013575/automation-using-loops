# Exercise 3: Flow sequence or Flow chart using Repeat, While and Do-While loops

### Reg No : 212222223001
### Date   : 27.09.2024

## AIM: 
 To create a workflow in UiPath that reads data from an Excel file and writes the same data into another Excel file.
 
## Activites Required:
  1. Repeat
  2. While
  3. Do-While
  4. WriteLine
  5. Assign

## Procedure:
  1. Create a New Project.
  2. Create Variables (repeatCounter, whileCounter, doWhileCounter).
### Repeat:
  1. In main flow sequence, add Repeat activity and set the number of times to repeat.
  2. And add write line activity to print the output.

### While:
  1. Create a flowchart for while operation.
  2. Add while activity and connect the start to while.
  3. Set the condition for while and add the write line activity to display the output.
  4. Add assign activity to increment the counter.

### Do-While:
  1. Create a flowchart for do-while operation.
  2. Add while activity and connect the start to while.
  3. Add the write line activity to display the output.
  4. Add assign activity to increment the counter and set the condition for do-while.

## Result:
  Thus, the automation for loops(repeat, while, do-while) using flow sequence and flow chart has been implemented successfully.
